Lab assignment #4.2

This is a Conway's game of life simulation where the user specifies the number of generations
for the simulation to complete and the simulation will show one frame of the simulation per second

To build the file ```make``` this will likely default build to a.out but make will always state its build location

To run the file
```./a.out```
or
```make run```

To use cppcheck and cpplint run
```make check```

To run valgrind
```make valgrind```
